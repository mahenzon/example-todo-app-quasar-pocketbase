let's create some example application using pocketbase and Quasar (Vue). pocketbase is simple backend like filebase / supabase, but in one file. Quasar is framework with good components library. 

what I want to see:

auth
- user authentication using pocketbase - it has builtin auth and user management, utilize it

app
- some example application using pocketbase and Quasar - for example it can be todo list
- maybe we can do multiple lists for the user
- since we are doing auth, user can see only his own todo lists
- user has to have an ability to make some his list publicly available

at first create top level architecture

then go to details

then let's implement it.
